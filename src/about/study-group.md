# Study Group - Cloud Security
null Cloud Security Study Group ran through the duration of **Feb, 2021 - Aug, 2021**.

## Mentors

- [Madhu Akula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhuakula/)

## Structure
Here are the things at a very high level of the structure or things we wanted to do in the null Cloud Security study group.

- Pre-requirements for the study group with learning the basic fundamentals
    - Basic Sysadmin, Networking, Programming, etc.
- AWS Fundamentals (Learning more about services and understanding them)
    - The course has been provided
- AWS Security Fundamentals Certification (Helps to understand basic security concepts in AWS)
    - The course has been provided
    - Everyone needs to be AWS Security Fundamentals certified
- Important Services Security Deep DiveSetup service(using provided resources) and perform offensive side basic security tests. Then perform defensive security controls and test attacks payloads used earlier.
    - Compute
        - EC2
        - Lambda
        - EKS
        - Others.
    - Storage
        - S3
        - RDS
        - Elastic Cache
        - Others.
    - IAM
    - Logging & Monitoring
    - Many others...
- Learning more about security testing in AWS and how to perform(Ex: CloudGoat)
    - This will be focused on how to perform penetration testing
    - We will leverage TTPs and perform attackers perspective
    - Understanding attack surface, attack matrix, etc.
    - Deep dive into offensive security
- Learning more about security defense in AWS and how to perform(AWS well-architected framework, introduction to terraform, cloud formation like tech)
    - This will be focused on how to perform a defense in AWS
    - We will leverage TTPs and perform defenders perspective
    - An understanding layered approach, defense in depth, security controls, etc.
    - Deep dive into defensive security
- Architecture & Automation parts
    - We will be reviewing how real-world architectures looks like(Make students build their own well-architected setup. Ex: setup storage services on your AWS account and review them on a call. Do the same for computing services)
    - We will leverage the power of automation to build things
        - Terraform, Cloudformation, Lambda, etc.
    - How to leverage Cloud for both offensive & defensive using the power of automation(CTFs if it is possible)
- Trying to cover other cloud providers in a similar manner as above (Depends on time and resources GCP, Azure, DO, OpenStack, etc.)Theoretically(if possible, do practical) take up X services of Azure or GCP or Do and explain how they align with Y services of AWS.
- Giving more references and resources

> Note: This is what planned in the initial stage. Due to the constraints, we haven't completed everything as part of this study group.

We also did ample amount of hands-on using the open source learning material - 
- [flaws.cloud](http://flaws.cloud/)
- [flaws2.cloud](http://flaws2.cloud/)
- [Cloud Goat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat)

Along with trying out different tools -
- CloudTracker
- PMapper
- PolicySentry
- AirIAM
- enumerate-iam
- serverless-puresec-cli
- Parliament    
- iamlive

> We started with AWS Cloud in this iteration of the Cloud Security Study Group, and plan to move forward with different cloud service providers in next iterations.
